# Basic concepts in NeTEx

NeTEx can support multiple use cases. Here we talk about the Swiss timetable delivery.

The following diagram shows the relevant core classes we will use. In the center is the ServiceJourney.

*Core elements for timetables in NeTEx*

Notes:
* Every `ServiceJourney` belongs to one `Line` and has one `Operator`. Some more information can be stored in associated `ResponsibilitySet`s (difference between operator and legal "owner"). 
* The pattern of the stops is defined in a `ServiceJourneyPattern` with additional details about each stop.
* The timing behaviour is stored in `TimeDemandType`. They contain run times and where needed wait times. The `TimingLink`s are mostly based on `ScheduledStopPoint`s and may be used by multiple `ServiceJourneyPattern`.
* The physical stops are modeled as `StopPlace`s with `Quays`.
* `ScheduledStopPoint`s are the "logical" stops.
* The `PassengerStopAssignment` associates the physical and the logical stops.
* `DefaultConnection` and `SiteConnection` define transfers based on site elements.
* `ServiceJourneyInterchange`s are used for splitting, joining and connecting trains and for "Durchbindungen".
* `Notice`, `ServiceFacility` and `SiteFacility` model almost everything else (especially offers).
* The operating days are defined through `ValidDayBits` for the whole timetable year in `AvailabilityCondition`s.
