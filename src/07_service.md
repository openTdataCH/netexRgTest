### Contained Elements
The `ServiceFrame` model comprises among others:
-	Route model: fixed and flexible  `Line`s and `Route`s of a transport network.
-	Line network model: overall topology of the `Line` and line sections that make up a transport network.
-	Service pattern model: `ScheduledStopPoint`s, `ServiceLink`, i.e., points and links referenced by schedules.

Other important classes of the `ServiceFrame` include:
-	`PassengerStopAssignment`s and `PassengerBoardingPositionAssignment` which model the relationship between stops in the timetable and the physical platforms of an actual station or other stop.
-	Connections (`DefaultConnection`, `SiteConnection`, `TimingLink`) as the topological model of interchanges. They model the possibility of a transfer between two `ScheduledStopPoint`s.
-	`Notice`s which are then assigned to `Journey` and `TimetabledPassingTime` of the `TimetableFrame` through `NoticeAssignment`s. They model the association of footnotes and passenger information content such as stop announcements and the network.

### Table
- [Swiss profile NeTEx definition](../site/tables/ServiceFrame.md)

*→ [General NeTEx definition ](../generated/netex-html/ServiceFrame.html)*

### Example
- [Example snippet](../site/xml-snippets/ServiceFrame.xml)

*→ [Template](./templates/ServiceFrame.xml)*

### Frame Relationships
`ServiceFrame` depends on `ResourceFrame` for `Operator` definitions. `VehicleScheduleFrame` may reference journeys defined here for block and duty scheduling. `PassengerStopAssignment`s build the connection between `ScheduledStopPoints` and the physical model in `SiteFrame`. `ServiceFrame` is typically wrapped in a `CompositeFrame` within a `PublicationDelivery`.


## Direction
We don't use `Direction` but only `DirectionType`. For this we need NeTEx 2.1.

This means that the old two defined dirctions `ch:1:Direction:H` and `ch:1:Direction:R` will no longer be supported.


## Line
*→ [Glossary definition](A4_annex_glossary.md#line)*
### Purpose
A public transport service line, representing a marketed route with a `Name`, `TransportMode`, and `Operator`.

### Table

*-> [General NeTEx definition](../generated/netex-html/Line.html)*

### Example

- [Example snippet](../site/xml-snippets/Line.xml)

*->[Template](./templates/Line.xml)*

### Usage Notes
- slnid will be integrated wherever possible. We currently think that - where it exists - it has the necessary properties to be used in the `id`-attribute.
- For foreign lines an `id` might need to be generated.
- We store the slnid whenever possible in `id`, `privateCodes/PrivateCode` and `KeyList`.
- Information about the Swiss line id (slnid) can be found [here](https://www.oev-info.ch/de/datenmanagement/swiss-identification-public-transport-sid4pt/swiss-line-identification-slnid).
- Handling of mixed lines is defined in its own [use case (uc017)](uc17_mixed_lines). The relevant factors are described in the Line element as well. We have a full [example](examples/NeTEx_CH_Linie_722_Mischbetrieb.xml) on it. - Be aware that for mixed lines there might be multiple `Line`s in NeTEx. Otherwise, the relevant `Operator` must be set on the `ServiceJourney`.
- Note that there exist journeys in Switzerland and neighboring countries that are not associated with a `Line`. In NeTEx, however, the `ServiceJourney`s corresponding to such journeys must still reference something in `LineRef`. To ensure this, we introduce a placeholder `Line` called "NoLine" for each `Operator` that has journeys without a Line.
- For more information about SwissLineID: see [here](https://www.xn--v-info-vxa.ch/sites/default/files/2023-06/slnid-spezifikation_v1.25_0.pdf).
- We have in the slnid concept also "Dispositionslinie" and "Temporäre Linie". Those are modeled as regular `Line`. "Betriebliche Linie" is not used and modeled in NeTEx. If at some point we need to know this type. We will model it as a Key/Value pair.
- If there are partial lines, there is also a main line. The patterns and journeys are always attached to the partial lines.
- id-attribute needs to be kept stable between exports.

## GroupOfLines
*→ [Glossary definition](A4_annex_glossary.md#groupoflines)*
### Purpose
A `GroupOfLines` is used to model mixed lines. For details see [uc17](uc17_mixed_lines.md).

### Table
- [Swiss profile NeTEx definition](../site/tables/GroupOfLines.md)

*-> [General NeTEx definition](../generated/netex-html/GroupOfLines.html)*

### Example

- [Example snippet](../site/xml-snippets/GroupOfLines.xml)

*->[Template](./templates/GroupOfLines.xml)*

### Usage Notes
- Only mixed lines have a `GroupOfLines`.
- All `ServiceJourneyPattern` and `ServiceJourney` are assigned to the partial lines.
- In very rare cases the main line has two legal owners. We discuss the modeling in [uc17](uc17_mixed_lines.md).
- The id-attribute should be the number of the main line.

## DestinationDisplay
*→ [Glossary definition](A4_annex_glossary.md#destinationdisplay)*

### Purpose
Showing the destination of a `ServiceJourney`. The text shown on the front or side of a public transport vehicle to indicate its destination, including via-points and variant labels.

### Table
- [Swiss profile NeTEx definition](../site/tables/DestinationDisplay.md)

*-> [General NeTEx definition](../generated/netex-html/DestinationDisplay.html)*

### Example

- [Example snippet](../site/xml-snippets/DestinationDisplay.xml)

*->[Template](./templates/DestinationDisplay.xml)*

### Usage Notes
- In HRDF sometimes the destination is not set (`*R`). This results in NeTEX in a calculated destination definition. 
- The `DestinationDisplay` is usually set on the `ServiceJourney`. If it changes during the run, it needs to be changed in the `ServiceJourneyPattern`. If it changes on that, then the new destination should be used. In our output, we will fill all remaining `PointsInJourneyPattern`with the relevant change.
- See also the [use case on changes in destination](uc13_changes_in_destination.md) 
- id-attribute needs to be kept stable between exports.

> **LATER**: We will clarify the rules how this is done.

## ScheduledStopPoint
*→ [Glossary definition](A4_annex_glossary.md#scheduledstoppoint)*

### Purpose
A logical point used in the timetable to indicate a stop of a service where passengers can board or alight. A `ScheduledStopPoint` is linked to a physical `Quay` or `StopPlace` via a [PassengerStopAssignment](#passengerstopassignment). 

A `ScheduledStopPoint` can represent two types of stop points:
-	In most cases, the `ScheduledStopPoint` is the station named in the timetable, especially as some organisations don’t have a full physical model of their StopPlaces. 
-	In some cases, the `ScheduledStopPoint` may be mapped to the `Quay`. The more detailed mapping is also done with the `PassengerStopAssignment`.


### Table
- [Swiss profile NeTEx definition](../site/tables/ScheduledStopPoint.md)

*-> [General NeTEx definition](../generated/netex-html/ScheduledStopPoint.html)*

### Example

- [Example snippet](../site/xml-snippets/ScheduledStopPoint.xml)

*->[Template](./templates/ScheduledStopPoint.xml)*

### Usage Notes
- id-attribute needs to be kept stable between exports.

## PassengerStopAssignment
*→ [Glossary definition](A4_annex_glossary.md#passengerstopassignment)*

### Purpose

`PassengerStopAssignment`s bring the Site model and the Service model in alignment. We have two general cases:
-	A `ScheduledStopPoint` in a `ServiceJourneyPattern` is linked to a `StopPlace` for arrival and departure.
-	A `ScheduledStopPoint` in a `ServiceJourneyPattern` is linked to a `Quay` for arrival and departure. In that case, both `Quay` and `StopPlace` have to be referenced. 

### Table
- [Swiss profile NeTEx definition](../site/tables/PassengerStopAssignment.md)

*-> [General NeTEx definition](../generated/netex-html/PassengerStopAssignment.html)*

### Example

- [Example snippet](../site/xml-snippets/PassengerStopAssignment.xml)

*->[Template](./templates/PassengerStopAssignment.xml)*

### Usage Notes
- id-attributes don't need to be stable.



## DefaultConnection
*→ [Glossary definition](A4_annex_glossary.md#defaultconnection)*

### Purpose
`DefaultConnections` are used to transmit the connection times for the following constellations:
-	between 2 `ProductCategory`s
-	between 2 `Operator`s
-	In a defined `StopPlace`
-	In a defined `StopPlace` and 2 `Operator`s
-	in a defined `StopPlace`, 2 `Operator`s and 2 `ProductCategory`s


### Table
- [Swiss profile NeTEx definition](../site/tables/DefaultConnection.md)

*-> [General NeTEx definition](../generated/netex-html/DefaultConnection.html)*

### Example

- [Example snippet](../site/xml-snippets/DefaultConnection.xml)

*->[Template](./templates/DefaultConnection.xml)*

### Usage Notes
- For more details see the [use case on transfers](uc03_transfers.md).
- id-attribute needs to be kept stable between exports.


## SiteConnection
*→ [Glossary definition](A4_annex_glossary.md#siteconnection)*

### Purpose
- The `SiteConnection` describes the transfer times between two adjacent `StopPlace`s. 
- id-attribute needs to be kept stable between exports.


### Table
- [Swiss profile NeTEx definition](../site/tables/SiteConnection.md)

*-> [General NeTEx definition](../generated/netex-html/SiteConnection.html)*

### Example

- [Example snippet](../site/xml-snippets/SiteConnection.xml)

*->[Template](./templates/SiteConnection.xml)*

### Usage Notes
For more details see the [use case on transfers](uc03_transfers.md).



## TimingLink
*→ [Glossary definition](A4_annex_glossary.md#timinglink)*

### Purpose
`TimingLink` defines the topological link between two `TimingPoint`s (in practice
`ScheduledStopPoint`s, referenced via `FromPointRef`/`ToPointRef`) used within a
`ServiceJourneyPattern`. `TimingLink` itself does **not** carry run or wait time
values — these are defined per `TimeDemandType` via `JourneyRunTime` (referencing
the `TimingLink` through `TimingLinkRef`) and `JourneyWaitTime` (referencing the
`ScheduledStopPoint` directly through `TimingPointRef`, not via `TimingLink`).
See [TimeDemandType](#timedemandtype).

### Table

- [Swiss profile NeTEx definition](../site/tables/TimingLink.md)

*-> [General NeTEx definition](../generated/netex-html/TimingLink.html)*

### Example

- [Example snippet](../site/xml-snippets/TimingLink.xml)

*->[Template](./templates/TimingLink.xml)*

### Usage Notes
- It must fit with the sequence defined in `ServiceJourneyPattern`.
- `FromPointRef`/`ToPointRef` reference `ScheduledStopPoint`s (technically typed
  as `TimingPointRef`, substituted by `ScheduledStopPointRef`).
- If there is maneuvering or a change of quay, then a separate `TimingLink`
  needs to be added for that too.
- Multiple visits of the same `ScheduledStopPoint` within a
  `ServiceJourneyPattern` are addressed with a `JourneyWaitTime` that has a 
  `StopPointInServiceJourneyPatternRef` instead of a `ScheduledStopPointRef` like the regular ones.
- id-attribute needs to be kept stable between exports.

## ServiceJourneyPattern
*→ [Glossary definition](A4_annex_glossary.md#servicejourneypattern)*

### Purpose
`ServiceJourneyPattern` is used to describe the journey pattern (sequence and times of `ScheduledStopPoints`) of `ServiceJourney`.


### Table
- [Swiss profile NeTEx definition](../site/tables/ServiceJourneyPattern.md)

*-> [General NeTEx definition](../generated/netex-html/ServiceJourneyPattern.html)*

### Example

- [Example snippet](../site/xml-snippets/ServiceJourneyPattern.xml)

*->[Template](./templates/ServiceJourneyPattern.xml)*

### Usage Notes

ServiceJourneyPatterns are a common concept in the VDV interface world ("Linienfahrweg"). In order to model ServiceJourneys efficiently and to reduce overall file size, use the concept wisely: 
- `ServiceJourney`s sharing the same stop sequence and the same boarding/alighting options should use the same `ServiceJourneyPattern`.
- Do not just generate one `ServiceJourneyPattern` for each `ServiceJourney`.
- id-attribute should be kept stable between exports.


## TimeDemandType
*→ [Glossary definition](A4_annex_glossary.md#timedemandtype)*

### Purpose
`TimeDemandType` describes the timing pattern of a `ServiceJourneyPattern`:
`RunTime`s between consecutive `ScheduledStopPoint`s (via `JourneyRunTime`,
referencing the relevant `TimingLink` through `TimingLinkRef`) and `WaitTime`s
at a `ScheduledStopPoint` (via `JourneyWaitTime`, referencing the
`ScheduledStopPoint` directly through `TimingPointRef`). Multiple
`TimeDemandType`s can be defined per `ServiceJourneyPattern` to represent
different traffic or dwell conditions (e.g. peak vs. off-peak).

### Table
- [Swiss profile NeTEx definition](../site/tables/TimeDemandType.md)

*-> [General NeTEx definition](../generated/netex-html/TimeDemandType.html)*

### Example

- [Example snippet](../site/xml-snippets/TimeDemandType.xml)

*->[Template](./templates/TimeDemandType.xml)*

### Usage Notes
- `WaitTime` is only needed when greater than 0.
- `RunTime` references the relevant `TimingLink` via `TimingLinkRef`;
  `WaitTime` references the relevant `ScheduledStopPoint` directly via
  `TimingPointRef` — not via `TimingLink`.
- Multiple visits of the same `ScheduledStopPoint` within a
  `ServiceJourneyPattern` are addressed with a `JourneyWaitTime` that has a 
  `StopPointInServiceJourneyPatternRef` instead of a `ScheduledStopPointRef` like the regular ones.

## Notice
*→ [Glossary definition](A4_annex_glossary.md#notice)*


### Purpose
Informational or regulatory text associated with public transport services, displayed to passengers.
 

### Table
- [Swiss profile NeTEx definition](../site/tables/Notice.md)

*-> [General NeTEx definition](../generated/netex-html/Notice.html)*

### Example

- [Example snippet](../site/xml-snippets/Notice.xml)

*->[Template](./templates/Notice.xml)*

### Usage Notes
- Notice elements should only be used to convey information which cannot be transported using specific model elements. Do not use `Notice` when the information could be expressed by specific elements, e.g., `FacilitySet`, `DayType`, `ForAlighting`, `ForBoarding`. `Notice`s can be used to provide further information on `ServiceFacility`s but not as a replacement for them. Ideally, the description of a `Notice` is translated to the three official languages (DE, IT, FR), and possibly E.
- id-attribute doesn't need to be kept stable between exports.


## NoticeAssignment
*→ [Glossary definition](A4_annex_glossary.md#noticeassignment)*

### Purpose
Assign a `Notice` to an element. 

### Table
- [Swiss profile NeTEx definition](../site/tables/NoticeAssignment.md)

*-> [General NeTEx definition](../generated/netex-html/NoticeAssignment.html)*

### Example

*->[Template](./templates/NoticeAssignment.xml)*

### Usage Notes
- id-attribute doesn't need to be kept stable between exports.
