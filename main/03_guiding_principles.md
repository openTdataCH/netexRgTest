# Guiding principles
In providing NeTEx files we will follow some guiding principles.

## Completeness

A delivery must always be complete: 
-	in the time dimension : for the whole timetable year (from December to December), but only one timetable.
-	in the scale of the information exchanged : for all operators and all lines or sublines from each operator.
This allows the receiver to overwrite the old delivery with the new one without loss of data

## Base data
Some reference data are maintained by SKI. These data are identified by business values (Abbreviation, Number, ID, …).
These Business identifiers shall be used by the deliveries to enable their integration and homogenisation for the collection of timetable information. 
If attributes of these reference data are transmitted in the deliveries, SKI does not adopt the values of these attributes. SKI takes these values from the reference system.

The relevant reference data is:
-	Organisations
-	StopPlaces, Quays and the whole physical model
-	Lines (in a future phase)
-	Direction
-	Notices some specialised id and or types.
-	TypeOfValues
  -	For Notice
  -	For ProductCategory
  - For Service
- ValueSets
- Facilities

### Data supplier side
The data provider is responsible for the timely delivery of the complete timetable information with sufficient quality. Complete means all timetable data in the responsibility of the provider for the whole timetable period.

### SKI side
The data provider is responsible for the timely delivery of the complete timetable information with sufficient quality. Complete means all timetable data in the responsibility of the provider for the whole timetable period.

## Limits to scope
This realisation specification for public transport in Switzerland (NeTEx) is an addition to the official NeTEx standard. It contains the scope of NeTEx possibilities supported by SKI.
Beside this document there will be an agreement with each partner about more technical and operational details of the delivery. In general there are no differences in the implementation to this reference document. Any necessary technical changes need to be discussed with SKI.

## Harmonisation
Our profiles and data will try to converge on the 2028 new European profile, whenever possible.

## Easy for consumption
The data and file structures should allow for easy consumption (as easy as it get with NeTEx).
