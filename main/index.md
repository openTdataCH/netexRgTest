# Swiss profile 2.0 for NeTEx 2.0 - Realisation directive for public transport in Switzerland

This document describes the realisation specifications for the data transfer between SKI and the public transport in Switzerland, based on the official NeTEx standard.
It provides detailed clarifications and describes deviations from the official standard, with the aim of achieving consistent use throughout public transport in Switzerland.

The realisation specifications in this document will be agreed by the KIDS (“Kundeninformationsdaten-Schnittstellen im öV-Schweiz”) working group.

The realisation specifications will be officially released by the National Commission Customer Information (Nationale Kommission Kundeninformation (KKI)) . 

The realisation specifications mainly concern: 
•	detailed clarifications about points which have abstract and open definitions in the standard. 
•	detailed clarifications about points which have hitherto been handled inconsistently within public transport in Switzerland. 
•	intentional deviations from the official standard within public transport in Switzerland.

## Supported NeTEx version
This profile is based on [NeTEx 2.1 XSD](https://github.com/TransmodelEcosystem/NeTEx/tree/v2.1-wip). It is still work in progess, therefore it might change.

We will have a copy of the XSD we really use in production on [oev-info.ch](https://www.oev-info.ch/de/branchenstandard/technische-ausfuehrungsbestimmungen/fahrplandaten)

The relevant specification documents can be found in the appropriate stores with the number: CEN/TS 16614. eg. through [VSS](https://www.vss.ch/vss_de/)

## Binding nature
This document describes the way in which the NeTEx standard is specifically applied and interpreted in Switzerland. It forms the basis for agreements concerning the connection between the individual public transport partners for exchanging timetables.
