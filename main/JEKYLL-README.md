# Jekyll Documentation

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) is used in the Github Action [pages.yaml](../.github/pages.yaml) to generate static html pages from generated Markdown (and 
other source documents) in the `site` folder.

See [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) for more info about Jekyll.

This `jekyll` folder is used as a template for the site. It is copied to the `site` folder during the build.

## Jekyll Adaptions 

The following documents have been adapted according to project needs:
- The Jekyll configuration [_config.yml](_config.yml) 
- The Gemfile
- HTML files (header.html, footer.html, mermaid.html) in the _`includes` folder

### Mermaid

The Java script in `_includes/mermaid.html` is included in `_includes/footer.html`, and consequently, in the footer of 
the generated HTML. 

To use the mermaid Script for a particular page, it must be enabled in the Markdown header:

```markdown
---
mermaid: true
---
```

## How to locally build pages with Jekyll
