# ResponsibilitySet

Each combination of Authority and Operator needs a ResponsibilitySet. EntitiyLegalOwnership ismandatory. All other roles are optional. However, we prefer to have the Operation part as well. If given Journeys are operated by a different Operator, then a different ResponsibilitySet should be referenced in the ServiceJourney from the Line.
